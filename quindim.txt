Ingredients:

    2/3 cups butter, plus 2 tablespoons to grease baking pan – at room temperature
    2 cups unsweetened, shredded coconut flakes (save about 2 tablespoons for garnishing)
    2 cups sugar, plus 2 tablespoons for baking pan
    12 egg yolks – at room temperature (see Cook’s Notes)
    2 eggs – at room temperature

Directions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Place butter, coconut flakes, sugar, egg yolks and eggs in a food processor or blender. Process until combined, about 1 minute.

Grease an 8-inch diameter baking dish (see Cook’s Notes) with the 2 tablespoons butter. Sprinkle the 2 tablespoons sugar all over dish. Shake the pan a few times so the sugar sticks to the butter evenly.

Tip the egg mixture into the baking pan. Place baking dish into a large tray filled up with approximately 1 ½ inch of warm water (Bain Marie). Transfer tray and baking dish to the oven and bake, uncovered, until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean – approximately 1 ¼ to 1 ½ hours. Remove from oven and allow to come to a room temperature. Transfer to refrigerator and let sit for at least 6 hours. Gently flip the custard onto a large round plate (see Cook’s Notes). Garnish with 2 tablespoons of coconut. Slice and serve chilled.
